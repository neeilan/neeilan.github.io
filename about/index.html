	<h1>About</h1>
  <p>
    My name is Neeilan.
    
    I’m a student at the University of Toronto in Scarborough.
    
    I don’t want to join Medium, so this is where you’ll find anything I decide to write about.
    
    Right now, I’m interning as a software engineer at Google on the Flights team.
    
    Previously, I was at Amazon, working on the Retail platform, and did some machine-learning experiments primarily dealing with model explainability.
    
    Previously-er, I worked at Google on hardware-based microphone emulators, and build infrastructure for Google Now, Search, and Assistant.
    
    Before that, I helped build Shopify’s App Extensions framework, and the SmartFolio robo-advisor at BMO.

    Rewind a little bit more, and I was mostly watching terrible TV shows and a lot of NBA games (before Kevin Durant ruined basketball).
