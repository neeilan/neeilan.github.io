  <h1>About</h1>
  <p>
    My name is Neeilan. I’m a student at the University of Toronto in Scarborough. <br/>
    I don’t want to join Medium, so this is where you’ll find anything I decide to write about.
  </p>
  <p>
    Right now, I’m interning as a software engineer at Google on the Flights team. <br/>
  </p>
  <p>
    Previously, I was at Amazon, working on the Retail platform. <br/>
    I did some machine-learning experiments there, mostly around model interpretability and explainability. <br/>
  </p>
  <p>
    Previously-er, I worked at Google on hardware-based microphone emulation, and build <br/>
    infrastructure for Google Search on Android.
  </p>
  <p>
    Before that, I helped build Shopify’s App Extensions framework, BMO's SmartFolio. <br/>
  </p>
  <p>
    Rewind a little bit more, and I was mostly watching terrible TV shows and a lot of NBA games. <br/>
    That was before Kevin Durant ruined basketball.
